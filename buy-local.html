          Early designs focused on detailed descriptions and a text heavy
          design. Usability studies found that users thought the overabundance
          of text was unappealing and difficult to focus on and navigate.
          <br /><br />Along with user feedback, a subscription option was added
          to inform users of additions to the page and new businesses to the
          city.
